## Physics

**Thermodynamics by Enrico Fermi.**

You know when a physics book is good when the author's name is related to elementary particlea :)

[Kindle version](https://www.amazon.com/Thermodynamics-Dover-Books-Physics-Enrico-ebook/dp/B008TVLP6K/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1543513830&sr=8-1&keywords=enrico+fermi+thermodynamics])


**Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths David.**

Quantum Physics book that go beyond the cliches found in countless youtube videos. Its for physicists and engineers, so be prepared.

**Gravity: An Introduction to Einstein's General Relativity by James B.Hartle.**

I read that this is a very nice introduction that goes easy on the reader when it comes to maths. Has some pretty good reviews!

## Computer Science

**Introduction to Algorithms**

One stop for all algorthmic concerns.

**The Algorithm Design Manual**

Now that you know most of the algorithms and understand how they work, lets take it to the next level, lets design our own. This book will tell you things to consider which sometimes are so counter intuitive that make you not read the book, until one day in shower you have your 'aha' moment

[Kindle version](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena-ebook/dp/B00B8139Z8/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1544178690&sr=8-1)

**Design Pattern**

If you want to read your code and understand it even after 10 years, this book is for you.

[Kindle version](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1544178910&sr=8-1)

**Computer and Intractability**

Well all problems are not solvable but we can find good enough solution for them. This book can tell you all about those problems which are unsolvable and how to find which problems are unsolvable just by looking at them.
